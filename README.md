# InstaBot
Instagram Bot to automate commenting, liking and following other users.

While I was still learning Python, I was a bit skeptical whether writing code in Python is more efficient than in Java, as people always used to say. And the answer was yes!!

I started writing the code at 9 PM on the Sunday night, given I had no prior experience with Selenium (of course I learnt Selenium while writing this bot), I was able to get the bot properly working and finally slept at 1 AM :)
